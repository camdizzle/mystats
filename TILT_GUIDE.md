Welcome to your **Tilt hype hub**. This guide is the easy, no-jargon version of what MyStats does during Tilt runs—focused on what you and your community *feel* on stream.

## What Tilt tracking gives you

MyStats turns your Tilt sessions into a full show:

- **Live run status** so viewers always know what’s happening right now.
- **Who’s popping off** with leader and top-tiltee callouts.
- **Progress vibes** with run points, run XP, and daily/lifetime momentum.
- **Instant recaps** after each level and at the end of each run.
- **Overlay-ready outputs** for clean OBS scenes and stream widgets.
- **Chat-ready updates** so your community stays engaged without you doing manual math.

Think of it as your Tilt run becoming a mini esports broadcast, automatically.

## The live experience on stream

As you Tilt, MyStats keeps your stream looking active and exciting:

### 1) Real-time run tracker
Your overlay updates with:

- Current run status (active/idle)
- Current level and elapsed time
- Current leader
- Current top tiltee
- Live standings
- Run progress stats and long-term progress numbers

So even lurkers can immediately understand who’s dominating and how the run is going.

### 2) Level clear celebration
When a level is cleared, viewers get a **quick recap moment** featuring:

- Who owned the level
- Survivors and losses
- Level reward highlights
- Fast “what just happened” context

This creates a satisfying “checkpoint hype” beat between levels.

### 3) Run complete finale
When a run ends, MyStats delivers a **final recap spotlight** with:

- Top finishers
- Final run performance
- Big-picture progress for the day

It gives your stream a clean “end of match” payoff before the next run begins.

## Chat features your community will notice

MyStats can post Tilt updates in chat automatically, including:

- Level completion summaries

- Momentum/milestone style alerts

You also get viewer-friendly Tilt commands so chat can ask for stats and rankings without interrupting your gameplay flow.

Bottom line: your chat stays active, informed, and emotionally invested.

- Current run context
